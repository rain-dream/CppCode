// 5.8 Coonstexpr and consteval functions
/*
1. Constexpr functions can be evaluated at compile-time

2. To be eligible for compile-time evaluation, a function must have a constexpr return type and 
not call any non-constexpr functions when evaluated at compile-time.
Additionally, a call to the function must have arguments that are constant expressions (e.g. compile-time constant variables or literals).

3. Constexpr functions can also be evaluated at runtime

4. When is a constexpr function evaluated at compile-time
(1). According to the C++ standard, a constexpr function that is eligible for compile-time evaluation must be evaluated at compile-time 
if the return value is used where a constant expression is required. 
Otherwise, the compiler is free to evaluate the function at either compile-time or runtime.
(2). This also means that your compiler may make different choices for debug vs. release builds (as debug builds typically have optimizations turned off).

5. Forcing a constexpr function to be evaluated at compile-time
(1). Use consteval if you have a function that must run at compile-time for some reason (e.g. performance).
Such functions are called immediate functions.
(2). The downside of consteval functions is that such functions canâ€™t evaluate at runtime, 
making them less flexible than constexpr functions, which can do either.
