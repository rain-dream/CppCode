#include <iostream>

// 6.7 Logical operators
/*
1. Logical NOT

2. Logical OR

3. Logical AND

4. Short circuit evaluation
(1). If the left operand evaluates to false, logical AND knows it must return false regardless of whether the right operand evaluates to true or false. 
In this case, the logical AND operator will go ahead and return false immediately without even evaluating the right operand! This is known as short circuit evaluation, 
and it is done primarily for optimization purposes.
(2). Short circuit evaluation presents another opportunity to show why operators that cause side effects should not be used in compound expressions.
