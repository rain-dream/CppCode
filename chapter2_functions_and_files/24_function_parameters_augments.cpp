#include<iostream>

/*
1. A function parameter is a variable used in the header of a function. 
Function parameters work almost identically to variables defined inside the function, 
but with one difference: they are initialized with a value provided by the caller of the function.

2. An argument is a value that is passed from the caller to the function when a function call is made.

3. When a function is called, all of the parameters of the function are created as variables, 
and the value of each of the arguments is copied into the matching parameter (using copy initialization). 
This process is called pass by value. 
Function parameters that utilize pass by value are called value parameters.

4. Using return values as arguments

5. How parameters and return valeus work together

6. Unreferenced parameters
(1). In certain cases, you will encounter functions that have parameters that are not used in the body of the function. 
These are called unreferenced parameters.
(2). unnamed parameter
