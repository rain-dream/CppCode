# include <iostream>

/*
1. New programmers often combine calculating a value and printing the calculated value into a single function. 
However, this violates the “one task” rule of thumb for functions. 
A function that calculates a value should return the value to the caller and 
let the caller decide what to do with the calculated value 
(such as call another function to print the value).
